# Talk - Introduction to Machine Learning

This presentation was my first official lecture, with the goal of teach the core concepts of Machine Learning, basic algorithms implementation and data analysis to students and some professors from Federal Institute of Conc√≥rdia, where I've coursed the high school and learned programming.

This talk was part of a network security project in which I was a researcher for over 2 years, studying DDoS attacks and how to use Machine Learning to classify and predict attacks.

I had 24 hours from the call of the lecture to prepare the material and perform the 2 hours presentation. Even with a short time I think I got a great result.
